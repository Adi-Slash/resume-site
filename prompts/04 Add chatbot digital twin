That's great. Please now add the ability to have an AI chat with a "digital twin" which can answer questions about my career. Please use OpenRouter. My OPENROUTER_API_KEY is in the .env file in the project route. Please use the model named "gpt-oss-120b". Make the changes, make sure it works, let me know when it's ready for me.
